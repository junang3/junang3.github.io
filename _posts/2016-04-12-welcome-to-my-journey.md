Welcome to my journey.

Just created [my personal blog][1] in GitHub + Jekyll.

I have been a 'student' of life's experiences for (almost) more than 40 years, and as always [in awe][2].

Life, Science and Technology are actually the same:

> You’ll learn, as you get older, that rules are made to be broken. Be bold enough to live life on your terms, and never, ever apologize for it. Go against the grain, refuse to conform, take the road less traveled instead of the well-beaten path. Laugh in the face of adversity, and leap before you look. Dance as though EVERYBODY is watching. March to the beat of your own drummer. And stubbornly refuse to fit in.”
― Mandy Hale,

One life, enjoy and share more!
